"""Core-owned contract registry — the named extension points plugins implement (plugin-architecture.md §5).

Core defines the **interface** + the **DI token**; a plugin binds an implementation under that token
([`container`](container.py)); a consumer resolves it by the token. The token is namespaced by its
*providing* plugin (§6) even though Core declares the name here — that's the shared agreement, the one
surface both sides depend on instead of importing each other.

Cross-boundary contracts today:
  - `ai` provides `ai.LLM` (the configured-LLM factory) + consumes `knowledge.Retriever` (RAG).
  - `knowledge` provides `knowledge.Retriever` + consumes `ai.LLM` + `minio.Storage`.
  - tool plugins provide `postgres.Connection` / `minio.Storage`; an auth plugin provides `identity.Provider`.
The `Retriever` Protocol lives HERE (not in the engine) so the ai plugin (consumer) and the knowledge
plugin (provider) both reference it without importing each other.
