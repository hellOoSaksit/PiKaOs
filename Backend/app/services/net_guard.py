"""SSRF guard for outbound HTTP to user-supplied URLs (the compare/audit path).

Compare is the only feature that fetches arbitrary user URLs. Without a guard a
user could aim it at internal hosts — cloud metadata (169.254.169.254), `minio:9000`,
`localhost`, RFC1918 ranges — and via `/api/compare/render` (which returns the body)
read internal responses back. See docs/features/compare-hardening.md §1.

Two layers use this module:
- `assert_public_url()` — validate user-supplied URLs **up front**; the router maps the
  resulting `BlockedURLError` to HTTP 400 (a clear, hard rejection of bad input).
- `guarded_event_hooks()` — an httpx **request** event hook attached to every client in
  the compare path. httpx fires it for the initial request *and every redirect hop*, so
  a 302 to an internal host is blocked too. There it raises `httpx.RequestError`, which
  the existing `except httpx.HTTPError` handlers treat as a normal fetch failure (the URL
  is marked broken rather than crashing the whole run).

Stdlib only (`socket` + `ipaddress`) — no new dependency.
